## 🎬 What It Does

**Product Demo Generator** transforms any codebase into a polished, animated HTML product demo—the kind you'd see in a professional launch video. Simply paste your code (or a GitHub URL), describe what the demo should showcase, and watch Gemini 3 Pro generate a cinematic, self-playing demonstration with smooth GSAP animations, background music, and marketing-focused storytelling.

## 💡 The Problem It Solves

Creating compelling product demos is a **major bottleneck** for developers and startups. Traditional approaches require:
- Hiring video editors or motion designers
- Learning complex tools like After Effects
- Hours of screen recording and editing

Our tool eliminates this friction entirely. **What once took days now takes seconds.**

## 🔧 How It Works (Powered by Gemini 3 Pro)

1. **Input:** Paste source code or fetch from GitHub
2. **Stage 1 - Storyboarding:** Gemini 3 Pro analyzes your code and generates a scene-by-scene outline focusing on *marketing impact*, not just features
3. **Stage 2 - Code Synthesis:** Gemini generates a complete, standalone HTML file with 99% UI fidelity, GSAP timeline animations, and optional background music
4. **Output:** A downloadable `.html` demo ready for social media, investor decks, or product launches

## ✨ Key Innovations

- **"Magic, Not Process" Philosophy:** Compresses multi-step workflows into instant results (file upload → analysis appears)
- **Selective UI Focus:** Intelligently hides noise (sidebars, menus) to spotlight core features
- **2.5D Parallax & Immersive Reveals:** Marketing-grade visual effects generated automatically
- **Infinite Canvas Finale:** Demos end with a viral-worthy product logo reveal

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

- **React + TypeScript** frontend with Tailwind CSS
- **Gemini 3 Pro Preview** via `@google/genai` SDK
- **Streaming generation** for real-time outline & code output
- **GitHub API integration** for one-click repo fetching
- Built entirely in **Google AI Studio Build**
